# Task: Write a function that takes a positive integer n and constructs an array a of length n where a[i] = i^2 - i + 1 for 1 <= i <= n. The function should return the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) with i < j < k such that the sum a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is divisible by 3. Instructions:
# Think through how to construct the array a and determine the remainder of each element modulo 3.
# Count how many elements fall into each remainder category (0, 1, 2).
# Identify which combinations of three remainders will sum to a multiple of 3.
# Use combinatorial formulas to efficiently count the number of valid triples.
# Consider edge cases, such as very small values of n.
# After reasoning through your approach, implement the Python function.
# Review your initial solution for potential mistakes or inefficiencies, debug it, and make corrections if needed.
# Provide the rationale for your final approach and include only the corrected Python function implementation.

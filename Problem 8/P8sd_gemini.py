# Write code to create a function that:
# Takes a string of words.
# If the string contains whitespace, splits the string into a list of words using whitespace as the delimiter.
# If there is no whitespace but there are commas, splits the string into a list of words using commas as the delimiter.
# If there are neither whitespaces nor commas, returns the number of lowercase letters in the string whose position in the alphabet (with 'a' as 0) is odd.
# In your reasoning, consider:
# How to check for the presence of whitespace or commas.
# How to split the string correctly based on the delimiter.
# How to compute the number of lowercase letters with odd positions in the alphabet if no delimiter is found.
# How to handle edge cases, such as empty strings or strings with only delimiters. 
# After implementing your initial solution, review your approach by identifying any potential issues, edge cases, or mistakes. Debug your own solution, correcting any flaws you find. 
# Finally, state the rationale for your final, corrected answer along with the code.

# Task: Implement a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all vowels removed. Vowels include both lowercase and uppercase letters: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'. All other characters, including consonants, spaces, punctuation, and newlines, should remain unchanged. Instructions:
# Reason through your initial approach step by step, thinking about how to identify and remove vowels.
# Consider potential problems, edge cases, or mistakes in your method, such as empty strings or strings with no vowels.
# Debug your solution, making any necessary corrections.
# Provide the rationale for your final approach and include only the corrected Python function implementation.

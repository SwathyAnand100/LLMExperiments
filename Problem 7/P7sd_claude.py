#Write code for a function largest_divisor(n) that takes an integer n and returns the largest number less than n that divides n evenly.
# Consider how to efficiently find the largest divisor for any positive integer n.
# Think about what should be returned for small values of n, such as 1 or 2.
# Consider edge cases and how to handle them.. After implementing your initial solution, review your approach by identifying any potential issues, edge cases, or mistakes. 
# Debug your own solution, correcting any flaws you find. Finally, state the rationale for your final, corrected answer along with the code.

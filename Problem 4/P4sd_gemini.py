# Write code for a function that takes a string as input and returns the sum of the ASCII codes of the uppercase characters only.
# Uppercase characters are 'A' to 'Z'.
# If the string is empty or contains no uppercase letters, return 0.
# Consider how to identify uppercase characters and how to sum their ASCII values. 
# After implementing your initial solution, review your approach by identifying any potential issues, edge cases, or mistakes.
#  Debug your own solution, correcting any flaws you find. Finally, state the rationale for your final, corrected answer along with the code.

# Task: Implement a function that takes a string and returns the sum of ASCII values of uppercase letters only ('A'â€“'Z'). If the string is empty or has no uppercase letters, it should return 0.Instructions:
# Reason through your initial approach step by step, thinking about how to identify uppercase characters and calculate their ASCII sum.
# Consider potential issues, edge cases, or mistakes in your approach.
# Debug your solution, making any necessary corrections.
# Explain the rationale for your final method and provide the corrected Python function implementation.
